Contributing
============

Conventions
-----------

* Before contributing, open an issue and discuss about it with community (is it a bug or a feature ? What is the best way to achieve my goal ?)
* Use flake8
* KISS & DRY as much as possible
* Elegant and generic is good, simple is better
* Separate bug fixes and new features in several pull requests.
* Open a new Pull Request in "Draft" status until tests passed. Use at least 'bug', 'improvement' or 'feature' label.
* Commits messages are explicit and mention issue number (``(ref #12)`` or ``(fixes #23)``), they should contains corresponding tag (see below)
* Features are developed in a branch and merged from Github pull-requests.


Definition of done
------------------

* ``docs/changelog.rst`` is up-to-date
* An explicit unit-test covers the bugfix or the new feature.
* A frontend test (:path:jstests/nav-\*.js) covers the navigation bug fix or feature
* A JS *Mocha* test (:path:jstests/tests.\*.js) covers the JavaScript bug fix or feature
* Unit-tests total coverage is above or at least equal with previous commits. Patch coverage is 100% on new lines.
* Settings have default value in ``settings/base.py``
* Installation instructions and documentation are up-to-date

Check TODO in the source tree:

::

   find geotrek | xargs egrep -n -i '(TODO|XXX|temporary|FIXME)'


Pull requests
-------------

Before creating a pull request, ensure you follow thoses rules :

* Follow the guidelines of this page
* Self-review your code
* Add comments in your code, particularly in hard-to-understand areas
* Make corresponding changes to the documentation
* There is tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works.
* All new lines of code are tested
* There is an entry in the changelog file

It is important to add a label to the pull request corresponding to the perimeter. Release notes are generated according to labels of pull requests. This is the list of available labels for pull requests:

+-----------------+---------------+-----------------------+---------+

Commits in pull requests are following a naming convention in order to easily establish their perimeter. Commit is formated as ``emoji [tag] description of commit``.

You can use one of the above prefix for your commits but also one of the following (tags used only for commits, not for pull requests):

========= ========================= ========
Tag       Emoji code                Unicode
========= ========================= ========
Codestyle art                       🎨
Clean     fire                      🔥
Tests     white_check_mark          ✅
Release   bookmark                  🔖
Merge     twisted_rightwards_arrows 🔀
========= ========================= ========

* Run ``dch -r -D RELEASED``, update version in the same way and save
* Commit with message 'Release x.y.z' and push to ``master``
* Create new release on Github, with tag X.Y.Z, click on "Generate release notes"
* Wait for release to be published through CI

* Commit with message 'Back to development' and push to ```master``

* When creating a new release 'x.y.z' on github, Github actions will generate the .deb package file, and publish it on https://packages.geotrek.fr (see ``.circleci/config.yml`` file for details)
