  **Caution**: if you created additional database users, you may have to change their ``search_path``
  and/or their ``USAGE`` privilege.

**Experimental features**

  from Geotrek adminsite.

In order to enable those features under construction, add ``experimental = True`` in
``etc/settings.ini``. Note that none of them are used in *Geotrek-rando* yet.

    Give related permissions to the managers group in order to allow edition
    (``add_flatpage``, ``change_flatpage``, ``delete_flatpage``, ``add_touristiccontent`` ...).

* UbuntuGIS stable maintainers have *upgraded* (sic) GDAL to 1.10.0.
  Upgrading GDAL is painful, and PostGIS packages may have to be reinstalled
  (data shouldn't be lost though). *Remember it was recommended to run PostGIS
  on a different server*.

:notes:

    On June 2th 2014, the Ubuntu GIS stable repository switched from ``libgdal1``
    to ``libgdal1h``. It broke the deployment script of many projects, including
    *Geotrek*.

    It is a good thing, since it paves the way for the last Ubuntu LTS release (14.04). However, it breaks the *Long Term Support* philosophy of the previous one (12.04), supposed to be supported until 2019.

    **Morality** : we cannot trust the *Ubuntu GIS stable* repository anymore.

    Regarding *Geotrek*, such upgrades of Ubuntu packages is not supposed to be covered
    by its installation script. If you face any problems, please refer to the
    community or commercial support (such as *Makina Corpus* for example).

          SELECT l_t_troncon.id AS troncon, l_t_sentier.id, l_t_sentier.nom
          FROM l_t_troncon, l_t_sentier

      otherwise screenshotting won't work.

    * After upgrading, load basic data for the new module ::

        bin/django loaddata geotrek/feedback/fixtures/basic.json

    * After upgrading, make sure the user specified in *Geotrek-rando* is
      in the group *Geotrek-rando*, or has at least the following permissions
      in the AdminSite :

      - ``paperclip | attachment | Can read attachments``
      - ``trekking | Trek | Can read Trek``
      - ``trekking | Trek | Can export Trek``
      - ``trekking | POI | Can read POI``
      - ``trekking | POI | Can export POI``

    controls sampling precision in meters (default: 20 meters)

* Altimetric profiles were removed from object map images
* Altimetric profiles are now plotted using SVG
* Altimetric profiles are now inserted into path documents and trek public printouts (ref #626)
* Fix deletion of associated interventions when editing infrastructures (fixes #783)
* Latest record is updated (*touch*) when a DELETE is performed on table (refreshs cache) (fixes #698)

* Reworked settings mechanism to follow Django best practices

:notes:

    Replace all computed values from ``etc/settings.ini``. For example, replace "60 * 60"
    by 3600. (You can increase this value to several hours by the way)

* Allow server host to capture pages (fixes #733)
* Adjust map capture according to geometry aspect ratio (fixes #627)
* Always show path layer in detail pages (fixes #781)
* Fix restore of topology on loop paths (fixes #760)
* Fix topology construction when loop is formed by two convergent paths (fixes #768)
* Added small tool page at ``/tools/extents/`` to visualize configured extents (ref #732)
* Removed setting ``spatial_extent_wgs84``, now computed automatically from ``spatial_extent``,
  with a padding of 10%.

:notes:

    Have a look at ``conf/settings.ini.sample`` to clean-up unnecessary values from your
    settings file.

* Fix paths offset for portrait spatial extent (fixes #732)
* Rely on Tilecache default max resolution formulae (fixes #732)
* Due to bug in Leaflet/Proj4Leaflet (https://github.com/kartena/Proj4Leaflet/issues/37)
  landscape spatial extents are not supported. Please adjust spatial_extent to be a portrait or square,
  or application will raise *ImproperlyConfiguredError*.
* Reload map objects on zoom out too (fixes #435)
* Fix computation of *min_elevation* for point topologies (fixes #808)

:notes:

    In order to recompute all paths topologies altimetry information, you can perform
    the following query: ``UPDATE e_t_evenement SET decallage = decallage;``.
    Reading information from rasters is costly. Be prepared to wait for a while.
