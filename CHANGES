CHANGELOG
=========


0.20 (unreleased)
-----------------

* Edit difficulty id in Admin site, mainly used to order difficulty levels (fixes #771)
* Use explicit list of fields in forms, instead of excluding model fields (fixes #736).
  Issue #712 was closed too, since most suspected cause was field listings. Please re-open 
  if problem re-appears.
* Fix timeout on POI Shapefile and CSV exports (fixes #672)
* Altimetric profiles are now computed in PostGIS (fixes #778, #779)
* Positive and negative ascents are now computed using more DEM resolution (fixes #776)

:notes:

    Setting ``PROFILE_MAXSIZE`` was replaced by ``ALTIMETRIC_PROFILE_PRECISION`` which 
    controls sampling precision in meters (default: 20 meters)

* Altimetric profiles were removed from object map images
* Altimetric profiles are now plotted using SVG
* Altimetric profiles are now inserted into path documents and trek public printouts (ref #626)
* Fix deletion of associated interventions when editing infrastructures (fixes #783)

* Reworked settings mechanism to follow Django best practices

:notes:

    Add mandatory ``[geotrek]`` section to ``etc/settings.ini``. See example at the
    of ``conf/settings.ini.sample``.

    Replace all computed values from ``etc/settings.ini``. For example, replace "60 * 60"
    by 3600. (You can increase this value to several hours by the way)
