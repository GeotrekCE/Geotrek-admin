:notes:

    * Before upgrading, backup your trail records and geometries, using pgAdmin ::

        CREATE TABLE backup_sentiers AS SELECT * FROM l_v_sentiers;
        CREATE TABLE backup_troncons_sentiers AS (
          SELECT l_t_troncon.id AS troncon, l_t_sentier.id, l_t_sentier.nom
          FROM l_t_troncon, l_t_sentier
          WHERE l_t_sentier.id = l_t_troncon.sentier
        );

    * Before upgrade, rename ``mailadmin`` to ``mailadmins`` and add
      a new line ``mailmanagers`` in ``etc/settings.ini``. See *Email settings*
      section in documentation.

    * Just before upgrading, delete the following folders  ::

        rm -rf lib/src/django-modeltranslation lib/src/mapentity

:notes:

    * After upgrading, load the default permissions of the previous groups, otherwise
      users won't have access to their modules ::

        bin/django loaddata geotrek/authent/fixtures/minimal.json
        bin/django loaddata geotrek/authent/fixtures/basic.json

    * After upgrading, make sure *Active* is checked for the user *__internal__*
      otherwise screenshotting won't work.

    * After upgrading, load basic data for the new module ::

        bin/django loaddata geotrek/feedback/fixtures/basic.json

    * After upgrading, make sure the user specified in *Geotrek-rando* is
      in the group *Geotrek-rando*, or has at least the following permissions
      in the AdminSite :

      - ``paperclip | attachment | Can read attachments``
      - ``trekking | Trek | Can read Trek``
      - ``trekking | Trek | Can export Trek``
      - ``trekking | POI | Can read POI``
      - ``trekking | POI | Can export POI``
      - ``feedback | Report | Can add report``

    * After upgrading, compare visually the resulting migrated trails using QGis,
      by opening both layers ``l_v_sentiers`` and ``backup_sentiers``.
